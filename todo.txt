Figure out why this is happening.

- add profit tracking for each strategy
    - each completed strategy has a method that tracks the sum total of all of the orders, positive or negative. we save that in a new field on the strategy when it’s in completed state.
    - ~~order model needs a fee field decimal to track the fee in usd, which needs to be grabbed from the gemini response.~~
    - strategy model needs a  proceeds field, which is the sell price - buy price * amount - fee of all orders in the strategy. The assumption is that each strategy completely exits the trade when it’s at the completion stage. The strategy model should only have the proceeds field filled when it’s completed, otherwise it’s zero by default.
    - We should also track the duration of the strategy from creation to end, which we can with a new field called duration, which is saved when the strategy enters state failed, or completed.

- add a fastapi interface
    - dashboard that shows total profits, breakdown by TradingStrategy and Trading Pair
- TODO: Evaluations → a field that is the reasons a trade was made, so that if the trade succeeds or fails, the AI can learn from experience.

 I can also train it via books on trading, potentially
