TODO: Implement DOGE Reversal Strategy

1. Current Implementation (Using RANGE Strategy):
- Three-level scaling entry âœ“
  * Level 1: 0.38000 (2000 DOGE)
  * Level 2: 0.36500 (2500 DOGE)
  * Level 3: 0.35000 (3000 DOGE)

2. Future Improvements:
- Add trailing stop functionality:
  * Move stop loss up as price increases
  * Lock in profits on strong bounces
  * Consider 3% trailing distance

- Add position management features:
  * Scale out on the way up (partial take profits)
  * Move stop to break-even after partial fills
  * Dynamic position sizing based on volatility

3. Technical Indicators to Add:
  * RSI for oversold confirmation
  * Volume profile for support/resistance
  * Multiple timeframe analysis (1H, 4H)
  * MACD for trend confirmation

4. Risk Management Enhancements:
  * Maximum total position size limits
  * Daily loss limits
  * Profit taking rules
  * Maximum number of concurrent positions

5. Monitoring Improvements:
  * Price alerts at key levels
  * Notification system for fills
  * Daily P&L reporting
  * Strategy performance metrics

6. Testing Requirements:
  * Unit tests for trailing stop logic
  * Integration tests for order management
  * Test scenarios for partial fills
  * Performance testing with historical data

7. Logging & Error Tracking:
  * Implement Sentry for error tracking
  * Structured logging for all trades:
    - Entry/exit prices
    - Position sizes
    - P&L per trade
    - Execution times
    - Order fill details
  * Performance metrics logging:
    - Strategy win rate
    - Average R:R ratio
    - Drawdown tracking
    - Volume analysis
  * System health logging:
    - API response times
    - Order execution latency
    - Database performance
    - Memory usage
