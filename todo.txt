TODO: Implement DOGE Reversal Strategy

1. Current Implementation (Using RANGE Strategy):
- Three-level scaling entry âœ“
  * Level 1: 0.38000 (2000 DOGE)
  * Level 2: 0.36500 (2500 DOGE)
  * Level 3: 0.35000 (3000 DOGE)

2. Future Improvements:
- Add trailing stop functionality:
  * Move stop loss up as price increases
  * Lock in profits on strong bounces
  * Consider 3% trailing distance

- Add position management features:
  * Scale out on the way up (partial take profits)
  * Move stop to break-even after partial fills
  * Dynamic position sizing based on volatility

3. Technical Indicators to Add:
  * RSI for oversold confirmation
  * Volume profile for support/resistance
  * Multiple timeframe analysis (1H, 4H)
  * MACD for trend confirmation

4. Risk Management Enhancements:
  * Maximum total position size limits
  * Daily loss limits
  * Profit taking rules
  * Maximum number of concurrent positions

5. Monitoring Improvements:
  * Price alerts at key levels
  * Notification system for fills
  * Daily P&L reporting
  * Strategy performance metrics

6. Testing Requirements:
  * Unit tests for trailing stop logic
  * Integration tests for order management
  * Test scenarios for partial fills
  * Performance testing with historical data

7. Logging & Error Tracking:
  * Implement Sentry for error tracking
  * Structured logging for all trades:
    - Entry/exit prices
    - Position sizes
    - P&L per trade
    - Execution times
    - Order fill details
  * Performance metrics logging:
    - Strategy win rate
    - Average R:R ratio
    - Drawdown tracking
    - Volume analysis
  * System health logging:
    - API response times
    - Order execution latency
    - Database performance
    - Memory usage

## AI Trade Monitor Feature
- Implement AI-based trade condition monitor that validates if initial entry conditions remain valid
- Required components:
  1. Entry Condition Documentation
     - Each trade strategy must document specific entry conditions:
       * Technical indicators (e.g. BB position, RSI levels)
       * Price action patterns
       * Support/resistance levels
       * Volume conditions
       * Market structure context
  
  2. Condition Monitoring System
     - Continuous monitoring of:
       * Changes in technical indicators
       * Violation of key levels
       * Volume profile changes
       * Market structure shifts
     - Real-time comparison with initial conditions
  
  3. Exit Signal Generation
     - Generate exit signals when:
       * Key entry conditions are invalidated
       * Market structure changes significantly
       * Risk/reward ratio becomes unfavorable
       * Technical setup breaks down

  4. Strategy Metadata Structure
     - Add to strategy config:
       ```json
       "entry_conditions": {
           "technical_indicators": [],
           "price_levels": [],
           "volume_criteria": [],
           "market_structure": [],
           "risk_reward_setup": {}
       }
       ```

Example for XRP BB Strategy:
```json
"entry_conditions": {
    "technical_indicators": [
        "Price above middle BB (2.2838)",
        "BBands widening indicating volatility",
        "Momentum positive above middle band"
    ],
    "price_levels": [
        "Support at middle BB: 2.2838",
        "Resistance target: 2.4200"
    ],
    "volume_criteria": [
        "Above average volume on upward moves",
        "Low volume on pullbacks"
    ],
    "market_structure": [
        "Higher highs and higher lows",
        "Middle BB acting as support"
    ],
    "risk_reward_setup": {
        "risk_per_trade": "$5.95",
        "potential_reward": "$34.05",
        "ratio": "5.7:1"
    }
}
```

## Priority
- High: This feature is critical for maintaining trade validity and reducing risk
- Implementation should be done before adding more complex strategies

## Next Steps
1. Design entry condition schema
2. Implement condition documentation in strategy creation
3. Build monitoring system
4. Create exit signal generation logic
5. Add to strategy manager workflow
